# Helium_PoC_ETA

Hi all, this a python_tkinter beginner project I had written using limited coding knowledge I had. If anyone had a better reconmmendation, do shot me your code so that I can further improve my coding skills.

*FYI, a proficient coder will ask many reason why I had writtern my code in such manner. The reason is I just compiled resources online and conducted 'try-and-error' until the code perform how I wish to.

Happy Trolling!
